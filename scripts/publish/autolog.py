"""Record a post in the performance log the moment its uploader has a URL.

Uploading and logging were two separate steps, and nothing enforced the second.
On 2026-09-17 the WS211 batch printed `20/20 submitted` and logged NONE of
them: the episode sat with 4 rows and no speakers until it was backfilled by
hand two days later, so every "who should front clips" question silently
excluded it. CLAUDE.md already said "Never post without logging" - a rule the
tooling did not help anyone keep.

Uploaders call log() right where they print their success line. It is
best-effort by construction: any failure is reported in that line and never
breaks an upload that already succeeded.

The speaker comes from the plan post's `speaker` key. It is the field the whole
loop exists to answer, so a post without one is reported as
`autolog: logged_no_speaker` rather than passing quietly.
